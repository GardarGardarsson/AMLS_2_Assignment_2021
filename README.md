# AMLS-II Final Assignment 2021
## Image Super-Resolution 
### University College London
#### Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering
**Student number:** *20167036*

This repository contains the final assignment from student number 20167036 for the *ELEC0135 Applied Machine Learning Systems-II* module. <br>
The project focuses on generating *Super Resolution* (SR) images from *Low Resolution* (LR) ones using deep learning techniques. <br>
More specifically, the project aims at developing and evaluating deep learning models of various architectures for solving the [NTIRE2017 challenge](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire17/#challenge).

The datasets used for training and evaluating the models may be accessed from the [DIV2K Dataset Website](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) 

**These instructions will be updated as the project progresses.**



To initialise `TensorBoard`:

- Open a terminal from your virtual environment
- In the terminal, navigate to the project directory, i.e. `/AMLSII_20-21_SN20167036`
- In the terminal, type in: `tensorboard --logdir='logs/'`
- Open a web browser, e.g. `Chrome, Firefox` and type in `localhost:6006` in the address bar
- The `TensorBoard` should load
