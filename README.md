This repository contains the final assignment from student number 20167036 for the *ELEC0135 Applied Machine Learning Systems-II* module. <br>
The project focuses on generating *Super Resolution* (SR) images from *Low Resolution* (LR) ones using deep learning techniques. <br>
More specifically, the project aims at developing and evaluating deep learning models of various architectures for solving the [NTIRE2017 challenge](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire17/#challenge).

The datasets used for training and evaluating the models may be accessed from the [DIV2K Dataset Website](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) 

**These instructions will be updated as the project progresses.**
